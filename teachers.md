Imagine a classroom where instruction is complimented by learners engaged in self-discovery; where collaboration, expression, and reflection are integrated directly into the learning experience.

Through the award-winning Sugar Learning Platform, students appropriate knowledge by engaging in activities that are authentic to them. With Sugar, your students at all skill levels can explore any curriculum goal more deeply. Your students will learn and they will learn to learn.

Your students will enjoy learning more and they will improve in regard to traditional metrics such as reading comprehension. And you will enjoy mentoring them and learning along side them.

### Features

Sugar is easy to learn: teachers and students discover how to use Sugar through exploration and collaboration—together, you learn by doing.

Sugar can accommodate a wide variety of students, with different levels of skill in terms of reading, language, and different levels of experience with computing. It is easy to approach, yet it doesn’t put an upper bound on a student’s personal expression.

The Sugar interface always shows a students connected friends. Students chat with each other, support each other, critique each other, and share ideas. Activities such as peer editing are just one “mouse-click” away.

Sugar uses a “Journal” to record each student’s activities: both what they make and how they make it. The Journal serves as a place for reflection and assessment of progress—a portfolio that can be shared with teachers, parents, and the student as they progress through grade levels.

### Pedagogy

Based upon 40+ years of educational research at Harvard and MIT, Sugar promotes “studio thinking” through demonstrations, projects, and critiques, as well as “studio habits of mind”, by developing craft, engagement, persistence, expression, observation, reflection, and exploration. In the context of Sugar, studio thinking is applied not just to the arts, but to all disciplines.

Reflective practice involves students applying their own experiences to practice while being mentored by domain experts. In the context of Sugar, the expert could be a teacher, a parent, a community member, or a fellow student.

At the same time, Sugar is flexible; it works coherently with the wide variety of instructional frameworks, deepening the student’s learning experience. Sugar also provides access to internet learning resources.

While Sugar is designed for elementary school classrooms, it will hold the interest of middle schoolers as well.
